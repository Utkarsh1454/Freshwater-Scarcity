                <h2>About Freshwater Scarcity</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Freshwater scarcity is a critical global challenge impacting ecosystems, communities, and economies across the planet. It occurs when the demand for freshwater exceeds the available supply, leading to a range of negative consequences.</p>
                    <p>Factors contributing to freshwater scarcity include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Climate change, leading to altered precipitation patterns and increased evaporation rates.</li>
                        <li>Population growth and urbanization, placing greater pressure on limited water resources.</li>
                        <li>Water pollution from industrial, agricultural, and domestic sources, degrading water quality and reducing availability.</li>
                        <li>Over-extraction of groundwater for agriculture, industry, and domestic use, leading to depleted aquifers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Freshwater scarcity not only affects human populations but also has profound implications for wildlife and ecosystems. Declining freshwater availability can disrupt ecosystems, threaten biodiversity, and exacerbate habitat loss.</p>

                <h2>Hilly Areas</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Hilly areas are characterized by rugged terrain and steep slopes, which present unique challenges for freshwater management. These regions often face water scarcity due to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High runoff rates: The steep slopes in hilly areas can cause rainfall to quickly run off the surface, leading to limited groundwater recharge.</li>
                        <li>Difficulty in water storage: Constructing reservoirs and dams in hilly terrain can be challenging and costly, reducing the availability of stored water.</li>
                        <li>Uneven distribution: Water resources in hilly areas may be unevenly distributed, with some areas experiencing abundance while others face scarcity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As a result, communities in hilly regions often rely heavily on rainfall for their freshwater needs, making them vulnerable to changes in precipitation patterns and drought events.</p>

                <h2>Plains</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Plains are vast, flat areas characterized by fertile soil and relatively low elevation. While plains may seem to have abundant water resources, they also face challenges related to freshwater scarcity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intensive agriculture: Plains are often used for large-scale agriculture, which can lead to over-extraction of groundwater and contamination from agricultural runoff.</li>
                        <li>Urbanization and industrialization: Rapid urban growth and industrial development in plains can strain water supplies and increase pollution levels.</li>
                        <li>Water management issues: Inefficient irrigation practices and outdated water infrastructure contribute to water loss and inefficient use of freshwater resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Addressing freshwater scarcity in plains requires sustainable water management practices, including improved irrigation techniques, watershed management, and water conservation measures.</p>

                <h2>Coastal Areas</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Coastal areas are regions where land meets the sea, encompassing diverse ecosystems such as beaches, wetlands, and estuaries. Despite their proximity to water bodies, coastal areas face several challenges related to freshwater scarcity:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Saltwater intrusion: Rising sea levels and over-extraction of groundwater can lead to saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers, rendering water sources unusable for agriculture and drinking.</li>
                        <li>Storm surges and flooding: Coastal areas are vulnerable to storm surges and flooding, which can contaminate freshwater sources and disrupt water supplies.</li>
                        <li>Population pressure: High population density in coastal cities increases the demand for freshwater, putting stress on limited water resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Addressing freshwater scarcity in coastal areas requires integrated coastal management strategies, including sustainable groundwater management, coastal protection measures, and promoting water-efficient practices.</p>
